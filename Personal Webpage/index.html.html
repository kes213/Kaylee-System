        <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I'm an aspiring lawyer -- but for now, I'm a sophomore English major at the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg. 
             I'm minoring in Political Science and History. I've been an assistant dance teacher for the Susan Yadamec Dance Company for the
             past 5 years, teaching tap and jazz to dancers from ages 4-14. I've been writing short stories for many years, but you haven't
             heard of any of them -- yet. I'm doing my best to manage school, dance, writing, and my personal life, and I think so far I'm
             doing an okay job. </p>
            <p>When I say "English major," people usually assume teacher, so I'll clarify. I'm a Creative and Professional Writing major, focusing
                on journalism. In my free time, I write creative fiction and manage my blog, "Lavender Reflections," where I publish reviews that 
                compare books to their movie adaptations, rating them to decide which medium tells the story better. If you're interested, 
                check it out <a href="https://lavenderreflectionsblog.wordpress.com/">here</a>. I'm an editor for the Pitt-Greensburg campus
                newspaper -- <i><a href="https://insiderupg.com/"></a>The Insider</i>.</p>
            <p>Here are some of my favorite things:</p>

                    <li><i>Wicked</i> the Musical</li>
                    <li>Disney movies (specifically <i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</i>)</li>
