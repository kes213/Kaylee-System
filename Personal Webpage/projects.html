             <h3>The Harlem Renaissance Project</h3>
                 <p>The Harlem Rennaisance Project is an exaluation and examination of poems written and published during the Harlem Renaissance, a period
                   of American history in which black culture developed and thrived. The project examines the popular uses or patterns of punctuation, as well
                    as connections between themes. The project authors will also compare our findings within the poems to newspaper articles from that time period.</p>
                 <p>Stay tuned for a link to the project's independent website and further information.</p>
