Xpath Exercise 3


1A)
I have to use the count function here. This expression counts all of the type attributes over the whole document, walking down the entire tree. 
count(//@type)

1B)
To climb back up the tree and return the elements containing the type attributes, I used this expression:
//@type/parent::*

1C)
The double slash tells Xpath to scan the whole tree for every type attribute, and then the parent:: axis climbs a step up to the elements containing those attributes.
The name function gives me their names -- <div> elements. 
//@type/parent::*/name()

1D)
distinct-values(//@type/parent::*/name())
This gets rid of any duplicates that came with the first return, and I find that all of them are contained in <div> elements. 

2A)
Again, the * tells Xpath to give me all results, and the double slash scans the entire tree. 
//attribute::*

2B)
The name function takes me off of the tree and only shows the literal names of the attributes, rather than selecting the attributes on the XML document. 
//attribute::*/name()

2C)
This function removes the duplicate values and returns the different attribute names only once.
distinct-values(//attribute::*/name())


2D)
//body//attribute::*/parent::*

2E)
//body//attribute::*/parent::*/name()

2F) There are 12 distinct values for the elements containing any attribute. 
count(distinct-values(//body//attribute::*/parent::*/name()))


3A
(//p[count(geo[@select="lat"]) gt 2])[last()]
It took a lot of tries to get me to this expression, most of which I posted to the DH Class Hub issues board already, so I won't repost them here. 

3B)
(//p[count(geo[@select="lat"]) gt 2])[1]
Here, because the entire expression before the 1 is wrapped in parenthesis, Xpath should walk the whole tree and find the first result of the results in the parenthesis. 

3C)
//div[@type="book"][2]//p[count(geo[@select="lat"]) gt 2])[last()]

3D)
(//p[count(geo[@select="lat"]) and count(placeName) gt 2])[1]

3E)
I know I would need the distinct values function here, but I'm not sure how to write it into the expression. I used these, but I got errors and I don't know
what else to try.  
distinct-values(//p[count(geo[@select="lat"]) and count(placeName) gt 2])[1])
//p[count(geo[@select="lat"]) and count((distinct-values(placeName)) gt 2])[1]
(//p[count(geo[@select="lat"]) and distinct-values(count(placeName) gt 2)])[1]
