XPath Exercise 2

1) 
An expression that finds only the longitute attribute values in the first book is:
//body//div[@type="book"][1]//p/geo[@select="lat"]
I found this by first navigating to the books, and then telling Xpath that I only wanted the first of those results. After that, I was able to climb down
the tree within only that book. I got 42 results using this expression. 

2)
Because the <p> elements are parent nodes to the <geo> elements, all I have to do is add 
parent::*
to the expression I used to the previous expression to jump back to the paragraphs surrounding the <geo select="lat"> tags. The full expression is:
//body//div[@type="book"][1]//p/geo[@select="lat"]/parent::*

3)
I needed to tell Xpath to return the third result from the type="book" attribute, and then the first result of the type="chapter" attribute, so I put
the respective numbers in square brackets. Then, I navigated to the lattitude attribute values in the <geo> tags once again, but because I wanted
Xpath to give me the first result within the paragraphs, I had to put that part in parenthesis so that Xpath only ran the expression for that specific section.
//body//div[@type="book"][3]/div[@type="chapter"][1]/(p/geo[@select="lat"])[1]
The number of this paragraph is 702.

4)
To select the <geo> tags throughout the entire document, I used this expression:
//geo
This expression told Xpath to search the entire tree, beginning with the root element and going downwards. Then, to jump up a branch to the paragraphs that
hold the lattitudes and longitudes, I used this expression:
//geo/parent::*

5)
I was unable to find an xpath expression that solved this question. I tried these options, and all of them failed:
//p/geo[@select="long"][not(geo[@select='lat'])]
//geo[@select="lon"]not(@select="lat")]
//p[geo[@select="lon"][not(descendant::geo[@select='lat'])]
//geo[@select="lon"]/parent::*not(geo[@select="lat"])
//geo[@select="lon"]//parent::*-geo[@select="lat"]
//p[geo not(@select="lat")]
I tried tons of differnt combinations with the not function and the - symbol which is supposed to mean subtraction. Nothing worked and I was unsure how to proceed. 

6)
The first expression 
//p[geo]/placeName[1]
is applying the [1] to only the <placeName> tags, so it's selecting only the first <placeName> in every paragraph. However, the second expression
(//p[geo]/placeName)[1]
is applying the [1] to select all of the elements in the parenthesis, so that tells Xpath to look for the first <placeName> in the first <p> containing <geo>.
seems to be returning
