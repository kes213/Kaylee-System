XPath Exercise 4

1) 
The string-join function will string together the authors in one list, and I insert the semicolon in the first argument space to separate them by semicolons.
string-join(//bibl/author, '; ')

2A)
The contains() function searches for the word 'homework' in all <div> elements in the whole tree. I got 18 results. 
//div[contains(., "homework")]


2B)
I have no idea how to write this expression, if I'm being honest. I know I need the descendant:: branch and the text() function, but I don't know how to correctly
write it in an expression. I based all of these off of my previous answer. 
//div[descendant::contains(., "homework")]
//div[contains(., "homework")]/descendant::

3A)
This expression returns the Fridays on the schedule. 
//body//div[@type="week"]/div[matches(., "F [0-9]")]//date

3B)
Because the yyyy-mm-dd date is on the when attribute, stopping on those attributes returns the dates in the descriptions. 
//body//div[@type="week"]/div[matches(., "F [0-9]")]//date/@when

3C)
I can't figure this one out either. I know I need the string-join() function, but I don't know how to apply it here. This is what I tried. 
I did this based on the expression in the example on the DH Class Hub wiki page.
string-join(//body//div[@type="week"]/div[matches(., "F [0-9]")]//date/@when, , ) 
This one I just tried to see what I would get, and it told me it failed due to unexpected "" at the start of the expression, which I don't understand at all because
I used the same base expression from the previous question and I didn't add any "". 
//body//div[@type="week"]/div[matches(., "F [0-9]")]//date/string-join(@when, , ) 
//body//div[@type="week"]/div[matches(., "F [0-9]")]//date/string-join(@when, ', ')
(//body//div[@type="week"]/div[matches(., "F [0-9]")]//date/string-join(@when), ', ') 

4A)
//body//div[@type="assign"][matches(., "GitHub")]

4B)
I honestly didn't know where to start for this expression. I looked on the DH Class Hub wiki as well as the XPath function link on the syllabus, and neither
had an example of the max() or min() functions, so I'm unsure how to write these into an expression. I wrapped them in a bunch of ways, but I couldn't get any results. 
I would really like to have an explanation of this one in class because I'm 100% lost. 
max(//body//div[@type="assign"][matches(., "GitHub")])
min(//body//div[@type="assign"][matches(., "GitHub")])
//body//max(div[@type="assign"][matches(., "GitHub")])
string-length(//body//max(div[@type="assign"][matches(., "GitHub")/max()
Some of the error messages I got implied that I needed to use the count() function here to compare a number, but I don't think that's what the question is asking . . .
I don't know where the string-length() would fit in, either. 

5A)
I read on one of the links that F stands for days of the week when using it within the format-date() function, so I used it here. 
//@when/format-date(xs.date(.), '[F]')
//@when/format-date('xs:date(.)', '[F]')
I modeled this exactly from the example on the exercise page, but it told me it doesn't recognize xs.date as a date. I also tried these:
//@when="xs.date"format-date((.), '[F]')
All of these gave me errors.

5B)
Because I couldn't get the first part of this question, I don't know what to try here. I did my best. 
//@when/matches(format-date('xs:date(.)', '[F]'))
//@when-"xs:date"[matches(format-date('xs:date(.)', '[F]'))]

I really struggled with a lot of the questions on this exercise. What confuses me is where I need to be putting the functions in order to form a correctly-formatted
Xpath expression. I receive a lot of errors due to my syntax. I just don't understand how to put them together. A lot of the lists of examples that I tried are not
complete because I tried to tweak these expressions so many times I don't remember what all I did. At the end of this exercise, I'm very discouraged and I think I
would benefit from another verbal explanation of how these functions can be written into Xpath expressions. Sometimes as I try to read the links and webpages that are
on the exercise, I find myself getting lost and unable to comprehend what I should be typing into the Xpath bar. I didn't post every question to the DH Class Hub
becuase I know the goal is for us to figure it out on our own, and I had a problem with consecutive questions. I did my best independently.
